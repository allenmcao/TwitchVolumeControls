# TwitchVolumeControls
Additional volume controls for Twitch. Retain volume levels on each channel, switch between volume profiles, and schedule volume changes! 

# How it Works
When listening to a stream on its main channel page, if the volume level is **changed** it will be memorized between pages. When navigating to the page again or switching channels, this memorized volume level will be applied.

# Todo
1. Enable list view in popup of each specific volume setting
2. Toggle to turn on and off per channel volumes.
3. Volume cap/equalizer
4. Support squad mode
